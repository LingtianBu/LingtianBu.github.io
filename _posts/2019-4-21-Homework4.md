# Challenge of Regularization

## Introduction
Different from China, citizens of U.S.A can own firearm legally under the regulation of state or local government as a liberty written in
the constitution. However the frequent shooting accident in recent have shake the belief of gun holding to its foundation. The appeal of 
imposing more constraints into firearm transaction is rising. 

Different people affected by different characteristics and value address different attitude towards the proposal. For example, the supporters
of Democracry definitely lean to the approval of the suggestion comparing to the Republicans.
